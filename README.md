# Route-Planner
Problem Statement:
You are required to design the complete system for 
an efficient monitoring and management of Ambulance Fleet of a hospital/organization/government. There will 
be two modules of the project i.e., 1. Scheduling of Ambulance for Patient Calls and 2. Dynamic route 
planning for ambulance optimal path (Shortest-distance finding problem). You can use any tool for its 
implementation. You can use bit-map method for simulation by using (60 x 60) or (80 x 80) grid and use cells 
as 2D locations e.g., start-state (2, 3) to destination (54, 55) with obstacles and roads infra-structure as well. 
First, map your problem and then propose solution.
